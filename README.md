FPLBase Version 1.0.0

# Welcome to FPLBase!

FPLBase is a low level rendering / input / asset management cross-platform C++
library. Go to our [landing page][] to browse our documentation.

FPLBase aims to take the grunt work out of getting games or graphical
applications up and running.
FPLBase can be built for many different systems (Android, Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS),
see `docs/html/index.html`.

Discuss FPLBase with other developers and users on the
[FPLBase Google Group][]. File issues on the [FPLBase Issues Tracker][]
or post your questions to [stackoverflow.com][] with a mention of
**fplbase**.

For applications on Google Play that integrate this tool, usage is tracked.
This tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string
(FplBaseVersion), and helps us continue to optimize it. Aside from
consuming a few extra bytes in your application binary, it shouldn't affect
your application at all.  We use this information to let us know if FPLBase
is useful and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this is open
source, you are free to remove the version string but we would appreciate if
you would leave it in.
